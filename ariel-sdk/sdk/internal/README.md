# Neon Platform SDK Internal

This is the internal platform SDK, used by Neon Framework and the public Neon Platform SDK. Contains implementation of interfaces defined in the public SDK
and some internal classes used by the Neon Framework only. These implementations mostly access AOSP private API that the public Platform SDK requires and are
AOSP API level dependent.
